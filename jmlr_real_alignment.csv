Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that learn how to accurately predict outcome variables using large sets of predictor variables that are typically not hand selected and are minimally curated. ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the most challenging phenomena of modern medicine. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that learn how to accurately predict outcome variables using large sets of predictor variables that are typically not hand selected and are minimally curated. Models are parameterized using a training data set and then applied to a test data set on which predictive performance is evaluated. The application of ML algorithms to the problem of AMR has garnered increasing interest in the past 5 years due to the exponential growth of experimental and clinical data, heavy investment in computational capacity, improvements in algorithm performance, and increasing urgency for innovative approaches to reducing the burden of disease. Here, we review the current state of research at the intersection of ML and AMR with an emphasis on three domains of work. The first is the prediction of AMR using genomic data. The second is the use of ML to gain insight into the cellular functions disrupted by antibiotics, which forms the basis for understanding mechanisms of action and developing novel anti-infectives. The third focuses on the application of ML for antimicrobial stewardship using data extracted from the electronic health record. Although the use of ML for understanding, diagnosing, treating, and preventing AMR is still in its infancy, the continued growth of data and interest ensures it will become an important tool for future translational research programs.",2021,0.4346086

2cb5b20e852cdde009a8570c064fb6021f51b161,Must-have Qualities of Clinical Research on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,"In the field of computer science, known as artificial intelligence, algorithms imitate reasoning tasks that are typically performed by humans. The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence-and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers’ artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models.

9bc2a3c526dd8b56818f44a1618c0a4ba4d3ed34,The Reporting Quality of Machine Learning Studies on Pediatric Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review,"Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health concern among children with the widespread adoption of advanced technologies. However, concerns are growing about the transparency, replicability, biasedness, and overall validity of artificial intelligence studies in medicine. Objective We aimed to systematically review the reporting quality of machine learning (ML) studies of pediatric DM using the Minimum Information About Clinical Artificial Intelligence Modelling (MI-CLAIM) checklist, a general reporting guideline for medical artificial intelligence studies. Methods We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from 2016 to 2020. Studies were included if the use of ML was reported in children with DM aged 2 to 18 years, including studies on complications, screening studies, and in silico samples. In studies following the ML workflow of training, validation, and testing of results, reporting quality was assessed via MI-CLAIM by consensus judgments of independent reviewer pairs. Positive answers to the 17 binary items regarding sufficient reporting were qualitatively summarized and counted as a proxy measure of reporting quality. The synthesis of results included testing the association of reporting quality with publication and data type, participants (human or in silico), research goals, level of code sharing, and the scientific field of publication (medical or engineering), as well as with expert judgments of clinical impact and reproducibility. Results After screening 1043 records, 28 studies were included. The sample size of the training cohort ranged from 5 to 561. Six studies featured only in silico patients. The reporting quality was low, with great variation among the 21 studies assessed using MI-CLAIM. The number of items with sufficient reporting ranged from 4 to 12 (mean 7.43, SD 2.62). The items on research questions and data characterization were reported adequately most often, whereas items on patient characteristics and model examination were reported adequately least often. The representativeness of the training and test cohorts to real-world settings and the adequacy of model performance evaluation were the most difficult to judge. Reporting quality improved over time (r=0.50; P=.02); it was higher than average in prognostic biomarker and risk factor studies (P=.04) and lower in noninvasive hypoglycemia detection studies (P=.006), higher in studies published in medical versus engineering journals (P=.004), and higher in studies sharing any code of the ML pipeline versus not sharing (P=.003). The association between expert judgments and MI-CLAIM ratings was not significant. Conclusions The reporting quality of ML studies in the pediatric population with DM was generally low. Important details for clinicians, such as patient characteristics; comparison with the state-of-the-art solution; and model examination for valid, unbiased, and robust results, were often the weak points of reporting. To assess their clinical utility, the reporting standards of ML studies must evolve, and algorithms for this challenging population must become more transparent and replicable.",2023,0.44026953

bfc50dfa41a0775ba39fe9ec628385e6014370ca,Applications of machine learning in tabular document digitisation,"Abstract Data acquisition forms the primary step in all empirical research. The availability of data directly impacts the quality and extent of conclusions and insights. In particular, larger and more detailed datasets provide convincing answers even to complex research questions. The main problem is that large and detailed usually imply costly and difficult, especially when the data medium is paper and books. Human operators and manual transcription has been the traditional approach for collecting historical data. We instead advocate the use of modern machine learning techniques to automate the digitization and transcription process. We propose a customizable end-to-end transcription pipeline to perform layout classification, table segmentation, and transcribe handwritten text that is suitable for tabular data, as is common in, e.g., census lists and birth and death records. We showcase our pipeline through two applications: The first demonstrates that unsupervised layout classification applied to raw scans of nurse journals can be used to obtain valuable insights into an extended nurse home visiting program. The second application uses attention-based neural networks for handwritten text recognition to transcribe age and birth and death dates and includes a comparison to automated transcription using Transkribus in the regime of tabular data. We describe each step in our pipeline and provide implementation insights.",2023,0.4072392

87e5c3f070567e74bb1d43c00cca18b4fc25a21a,Machine‐Learning Assessed Abdominal Aortic Calcification is Associated with Long‐Term Fall and Fracture Risk in Community‐Dwelling Older Australian Women,"Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), a recognized measure of advanced vascular disease, is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and poorer long‐term prognosis. AAC can be assessed on dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA)‐derived lateral spine images used for vertebral fracture assessment at the time of bone density screening using a validated 24‐point scoring method (AAC‐24). Previous studies have identified robust associations between AAC‐24 score, incident falls, and fractures. However, a major limitation of manual AAC assessment is that it requires a trained expert. Hence, we have developed an automated machine‐learning algorithm for assessing AAC‐24 scores (ML‐AAC24). In this prospective study, we evaluated the association between ML‐AAC24 and long‐term incident falls and fractures in 1023 community‐dwelling older women (mean age, 75 ± 3 years) from the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing Women. Over 10 years of follow‐up, 253 (24.7%) women experienced a clinical fracture identified via self‐report every 4–6 months and verified by X‐ray, and 169 (16.5%) women had a fracture hospitalization identified from linked hospital discharge data. Over 14.5 years, 393 (38.4%) women experienced an injurious fall requiring hospitalization identified from linked hospital discharge data. After adjusting for baseline fracture risk, women with moderate to extensive AAC (ML‐AAC24 ≥ 2) had a greater risk of clinical fractures (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–1.85) and fall‐related hospitalization (HR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09–1.66), compared to those with low AAC (ML‐AAC24 ≤ 1). Similar to manually assessed AAC‐24, ML‐AAC24 was not associated with fracture hospitalizations. The relative hazard estimates obtained using machine learning were similar to those using manually assessed AAC‐24 scores. In conclusion, this novel automated method for assessing AAC, that can be easily and seamlessly captured at the time of bone density testing, has robust associations with long‐term incident clinical fractures and injurious falls. However, the performance of the ML‐AAC24 algorithm needs to be verified in independent cohorts. © 2023 The Authors.

In this context, predictive quality enables manufacturing companies to make data-driven estimations about the product quality based on process data. In the current state of research, numerous approaches to predictive quality exist in a wide variety of use cases and domains. Their applications range from quality predictions during production using sensor data to automated quality inspection in the field based on measurement data. However, there is currently a lack of an overall view of where predictive quality research stands as a whole, what approaches are currently being investigated, and what challenges currently exist. This paper addresses these issues by conducting a comprehensive and systematic review of scientific publications between 2012 and 2021 dealing with predictive quality in manufacturing. The publications are categorized according to the manufacturing processes they address as well as the data bases and machine learning models they use. In this process, key insights into the scope of this field are collected along with gaps and similarities in the solution approaches.

4a70631f9dd83cc170764fbcce2d90912118acb1,Machine learning and natural language processing in psychotherapy research: Alliance as example use case.,"Artificial intelligence generally and machine learning specifically have become deeply woven into the lives and technologies of modern life. Machine learning is dramatically changing scientific research and industry and may also hold promise for addressing limitations encountered in mental health care and psychotherapy. The current paper introduces machine learning and natural language processing as related methodologies that may prove valuable for automating the assessment of meaningful aspects of treatment. Prediction of therapeutic alliance from session recordings is used as a case in point. Recordings from 1,235 sessions of 386 clients seen by 40 therapists at a university counseling center were processed using automatic speech recognition software. Machine learning algorithms learned associations between client ratings of therapeutic alliance exclusively from session linguistic content. Using a portion of the data to train the model, machine learning algorithms modestly predicted alliance ratings from session content in an independent test set (Spearman's ρ = .15, p < .001). These results highlight the potential to harness natural language processing and machine learning to predict a key psychotherapy process variable that is relatively distal from linguistic content. Six practical suggestions for conducting psychotherapy research using machine learning are presented along with several directions for future research. Questions of dissemination and implementation may be particularly important to explore as machine learning improves in its ability to automate assessment of psychotherapy process and outcome.

They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. VFs are incidentally found in one out of five imaging studies, however, more than half of the VFs are not identified nor reported in patient computed tomography (CT) scans. Our study aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm to identify VFs in abdominal/chest CT scans and evaluate its performance. We acquired two independent data sets of routine abdominal/chest CT scans of patients aged 50 years or older: a training set of 1011 scans from a non‐interventional, prospective proof‐of‐concept study at the Universitair Ziekenhuis (UZ) Brussel and a validation set of 2000 subjects from an observational cohort study at the Hospital of Holbæk. Both data sets were externally reevaluated to identify reference standard VF readings using the Genant semiquantitative (SQ) grading. Four independent models have been trained in a cross‐validation experiment using the training set and an ensemble of four models has been applied to the external validation set. The validation set contained 15.3% scans with one or more VF (SQ2‐3), whereas 663 of 24,930 evaluable vertebrae (2.7%) were fractured (SQ2‐3) as per reference standard readings. Comparison of the ensemble model with the reference standard readings in identifying subjects with one or more moderate or severe VF resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85–0.90), accuracy of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.91–0.93), kappa of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.67–0.76), sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.85), and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93–0.96). We demonstrated that a machine learning algorithm trained for VF detection achieved strong performance on an external validation set. It has the potential to support healthcare professionals with the early identification of VFs and prevention of future fragility fractures. © 2023 UCB S.A. and The Authors.

In this study, the predictive performance of machine learning models is compared with that of deep learning models for both global solar radiation (GSR) and diffuse solar radiation (DSR) prediction. Different studies have proposed the use of different models for solar radiation prediction. While some used machine learning models, the use of deep learning algorithms were considered by others. Although these algorithms were concluded to be appropriate for solar radiation prediction, variation in their performances brings about an intriguing quest to compare and determine the most appropriate algorithm. The three most common deep learning models in the literature namely; artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network (RNN) are considered within the scope of this study. Also, two traditional machine learning models namely polynomial regression and support vector regression (SVR) is considered as well as an ensemble machine learning model called random forest. These models have been applied to four different locations in Nigeria and the typical meteorological year data for 12 years in an hourly time step was used to train/test the model developed. Results from this study show that deep learning models have a better GSR and DSR prediction accuracy in comparison to machine learning models. However, the duration for training and testing the machine learning models (except SVR) is shorter than that of deep learning models making it more desirable for low computational applications. The application of RNN for GSR prediction in Yobe (with an r value of 0.9546 and root means square error/mean absolute error of 82.22 W/m2/36.52 W/m2) had the overall best model performance of all the models developed in this study.

da3342bf654cd5481894591e005d67dff57fb89a,A Novel Diabetes Healthcare Disease Prediction Framework Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that continues to be a significant and global concern since it affects the entire population's health. It is a metabolic disorder that leads to high blood sugar levels and many other problems such as stroke, kidney failure, and heart and nerve problems. Several researchers have attempted to construct an accurate diabetes prediction model over the years. However, this subject still faces significant open research issues due to a lack of appropriate data sets and prediction approaches, which pushes researchers to use big data analytics and machine learning (ML)-based methods. Applying four different machine learning methods, the research tries to overcome the problems and investigate healthcare predictive analytics. The study's primary goal was to see how big data analytics and machine learning-based techniques may be used in diabetes. The examination of the results shows that the suggested ML-based framework may achieve a score of 86. Health experts and other stakeholders are working to develop categorization models that will aid in the prediction of diabetes and the formulation of preventative initiatives. The authors perform a review of the literature on machine models and suggest an intelligent framework for diabetes prediction based on their findings. Machine learning models are critically examined, and an intelligent machine learning-based architecture for diabetes prediction is proposed and evaluated by the authors. In this study, the authors utilize our framework to develop and assess decision tree (DT)-based random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) learning models for diabetes prediction, which are the most widely used techniques in the literature at the time of writing.

Thus, several studies found that people who are contemplating suicide can be identified by analyzing social media posts. However, finding and comprehending patterns of suicidal ideation represent a challenging task. Therefore, it is essential to develop a machine learning system for automated early detection of suicidal ideation or any abrupt changes in a user’s behavior by analyzing his or her posts on social media. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on experimental research for building a suicidal ideation detection system using publicly available Reddit datasets, word-embedding approaches, such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec, for text representation, and hybrid deep learning and machine learning algorithms for classification. A convolutional neural network and Bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN–BiLSTM) model and the machine learning XGBoost model were used to classify social posts as suicidal or non-suicidal using textual and LIWC-22-based features by conducting two experiments. To assess the models’ performance, we used the standard metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. A comparison of the test results showed that when using textual features, the CNN–BiLSTM model outperformed the XGBoost model, achieving 95% suicidal ideation detection accuracy, compared with the latter’s 91.5% accuracy. Conversely, when using LIWC features, XGBoost showed better performance than CNN–BiLSTM.",2022,0.36655572

The gait analysis involves a large number of interdependent parameters that were difficult to interpret due to a vast amount of data and their inter-relations. To simplify evaluation, the integration of machine learning (ML) with biomechanics is a promising solution. The purpose of this review is to familiarise the readers with key directions of implementation of ML techniques for gait analysis and gait rehabilitation.

a9670054c1a5159e15ca61e1faeae9483be3f2ec,The use of machine learning in rare diseases: a scoping review,"Background Emerging machine learning technologies are beginning to transform medicine and healthcare and could also improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. Currently, there are no systematic reviews that investigate, from a general perspective, how machine learning is used in a rare disease context. This scoping review aims to address this gap and explores the use of machine learning in rare diseases, investigating, for example, in which rare diseases machine learning is applied, which types of algorithms and input data are used or which medical applications (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis or treatment) are studied. Methods Using a complex search string including generic search terms and 381 individual disease names, studies from the past 10 years (2010–2019) that applied machine learning in a rare disease context were identified on PubMed. To systematically map the research activity, eligible studies were categorized along different dimensions (e.g., rare disease group, type of algorithm, input data), and the number of studies within these categories was analyzed. Results Two hundred eleven studies from 32 countries investigating 74 different rare diseases were identified. Diseases with a higher prevalence appeared more often in the studies than diseases with a lower prevalence. Moreover, some rare disease groups were investigated more frequently than to be expected (e.g., rare neurologic diseases and rare systemic or rheumatologic diseases), others less frequently (e.g., rare inborn errors of metabolism and rare skin diseases). Ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) were the algorithms most commonly applied in the studies. Only a small proportion of studies evaluated their algorithms on an external data set (11.8%) or against a human expert (2.4%). As input data, images (32.2%), demographic data (27.0%) and “omics” data (26.5%) were used most frequently. Most studies used machine learning for diagnosis (40.8%) or prognosis (38.4%) whereas studies aiming to improve treatment were relatively scarce (4.7%). Patient numbers in the studies were small, typically ranging from 20 to 99 (35.5%). Conclusion Our review provides an overview of the use of machine learning in rare diseases. Mapping the current research activity, it can guide future work and help to facilitate the successful application of machine learning in rare diseases.",2020,0.5069471

71a85e735a3686bef8cce3725ae5ba82e2cabb1b,Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning,"ML models often exhibit unexpectedly poor behavior when they are deployed in real-world domains. We identify underspecification as a key reason for these failures. An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.",2020,0.41090712
8e30eecef7f815b1c001e9e179a366016fdf782f,"Transparency, auditability, and explainability of machine learning models in credit scoring","Abstract A major requirement for credit scoring models is to provide a maximally accurate risk prediction. Additionally, regulators demand these models to be transparent and auditable. Thus, in credit scoring, very simple predictive models such as logistic regression or decision trees are still widely used and the superior predictive power of modern machine learning algorithms cannot be fully leveraged. Significant potential is therefore missed, leading to higher reserves or more credit defaults. This article works out different dimensions that have to be considered for making credit scoring models understandable and presents a framework for making “black box” machine learning models transparent, auditable, and explainable. Following this framework, we present an overview of techniques, demonstrate how they can be applied in credit scoring and how results compare to the interpretability of scorecards. A real world case study shows that a comparable degree of interpretability can be achieved while machine learning techniques keep their ability to improve predictive power.",2020,0.42125645

3e6f0169e6bd3eaf7c52a3f1178020837f30b858,Mapping supply chain collaboration research: a machine learning-based literature review,"ABSTRACT Supply chain collaboration has been widely discussed in the literature. With this maturity comes a plethora of heterogeneous research that is difficult to manage and navigate. This paper, therefore, applies a novel literature review approach based on text mining analyzing 10,556 articles to provide an overview of previous research themes and future directions of the field. The applied method enables researchers to systematically analyze and structure larger samples of research publications. It allocates articles to thematic clusters using a visual hierarchical clustering approach and subsequently aggregates them into nine overarching themes to determine potential research and insights for practice. Developments regarding research interest and attention within these themes are examined and journals publishing the most impactful articles are identified. The paper thus contributes to the field of Supply Chain Collaboration research by mapping its evolvement over the last five years and by deriving a research agenda for the next decade.",2021,0.20120442

2776a9aa61016787c83b1fd45fc418408ec145d3,Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Based on Machine Learning Algorithm,"Prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence allows a person at risk to take actions that can prevent onset or delay the progression of the disease. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict T2D occurrence in the following year (Y + 1) using variables in the current year (Y). The dataset for this study was collected at a private medical institute as electronic health records from 2013 to 2018. To construct the prediction model, key features were first selected using ANOVA tests, chi-squared tests, and recursive feature elimination methods. The resultant features were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, age, uric acid, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. We then employed logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and ensemble machine learning algorithms based on these variables to predict the outcome as normal (non-diabetic), prediabetes, or diabetes. Based on the experimental results, the performance of the prediction model proved to be reasonably good at forecasting the occurrence of T2D in the Korean population. The model can provide clinicians and patients with valuable predictive information on the likelihood of developing T2D. The cross-validation (CV) results showed that the ensemble models had a superior performance to that of the single models. The CV performance of the prediction models was improved by incorporating more medical history from the dataset.",2021,0.4379084

fa93a0657fcf0872aac13ecdd6ed251d1100926a,Machine Learning–Derived Acetabular Dysplasia and Cam Morphology Are Features of Severe Hip Osteoarthritis: Findings From UK Biobank,"The contribution of shape changes to hip osteoarthritis (HOA) remains unclear, as is the extent to which these vary according to HOA severity. In the present study, we used statistical shape modeling (SSM) to evaluate relationships between hip shape and HOA of different severities using UK Biobank DXA images. We performed a cross‐sectional study in individuals with left hip dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) was used to quantify hip shape. Radiographic HOA (rHOA) was classified using osteophyte size and number and joint space narrowing. HOA outcomes ranged in severity from moderate (grade 2) to severe (grade ≥3) rHOA, hospital‐diagnosed HOA, and subsequent total hip replacement (THR). Confounder‐adjusted logistic regression between the top 10 hip shape modes (HSMs) and OA outcomes was performed. Further models adjusted for alpha angle (AA) and lateral center‐edge angle (LCEA), reflecting acetabular dysplasia and cam morphology, respectively. Composite HSM figures were produced combining HSMs associated with separate OA outcomes. A total of 40,311 individuals were included (mean 63.7 years, 47.8% male), of whom 5.7% had grade 2 rHOA, 1.7% grade ≥3 rHOA, 1.3% hospital‐diagnosed HOA, and 0.6% underwent THR. Composite HSM figures for grade 2 rHOA revealed femoral neck widening, increased acetabular coverage, and enlarged lesser and greater trochanters. In contrast, grade ≥3 rHOA, hospital‐diagnosed HOA, and THR were suggestive of cam morphology and reduced acetabular coverage. Associations between HSMs depicting cam morphology and reduced acetabular coverage and more severe HOA were attenuated by AA and LCEA adjustment, respectively. Relationships between hip shape and HOA differed according to severity. Notably, cam morphology and acetabular dysplasia were features of severe HOA, but unrelated to moderate disease, suggesting possible prognostic utility. © 2022 The Authors.

eaa458b963e0111616aaa5154f3cf3051fd86dd3,Application of machine learning methods for predicting new superhard materials,"Superhard materials are of great interest in various practical applications, and an increasing number of research efforts are focused on their development. In this article, we demonstrate that machine learning can be successfully applied to searching for such materials. We construct a machine learning model using neural networks on graphs together with a recently developed physical model of hardness and fracture toughness. The model is trained using available elastic data from the Materials Project database and has good accuracy for predictions. We use this model to screen all crystal structures in the database and systematize all the promising hard or superhard materials, and find that diamond (and its polytypes) are the hardest materials in the database. Our results can be further used for the investigation of interesting materials using more accurate ab initio calculations and/or experiments.",2020,0.37641922

f75702448cae8ef7282322de338197d0290a5735,Twitter Discussions and Emotions About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach,"Background It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. Objective The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19–related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. Methods We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, “coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” “quarantine”) from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. Results Popular unigrams included “virus,” “lockdown,” and “quarantine.” Popular bigrams included “COVID-19,” “stay home,” “corona virus,” “social distancing,” and “new cases.” We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. Conclusions This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning. Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.",2020,0.27941352
83e89d56d0d0e1dfd8b52213e6cc2e191aaaf34b,Machine Learning on Graphs: A Model and Comprehensive Taxonomy,"There has been a surge of recent interest in learning representations for graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data. The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work. Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g. GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc) into a single consistent approach. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we fit over thirty existing methods into this framework. We believe that this unifying view both provides a solid foundation for understanding the intuition behind these methods, and enables future research in the area.",2020,0.25783247
b2a4d743073e8769a350b90167be7527c12f133b,Ensemble machine learning approach for classification of IoT devices in smart home,"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept as a new direction of technological development raises new problems such as valid and timely identification of such devices, security vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious activities, and management of such devices. The communication of IoT devices generates traffic that has specific features and differences with respect to conventional devices. This research seeks to analyze the possibilities of applying such features for classifying devices, regardless of their functionality or purpose. This kind of classification is necessary for a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, such as a smart home where the number and types of devices grow daily. This research uses a total of 41 IoT devices. The logistic regression method enhanced by the concept of supervised machine learning (logitboost) was used for developing a classification model. Multiclass classification model was developed using 13 network traffic features generated by IoT devices. Research has shown that it is possible to classify devices into four previously defined classes with high performances and accuracy (99.79%) based on the traffic flow features of such devices. Model performance measures such as precision, F-measure, True Positive Ratio, False Positive Ratio and Kappa coefficient all show high results (0.997–0.999, 0.997–0.999, 0.997–0.999, 0–0.001 and 0.9973, respectively).

8ce97520335229fb3bb85e3f07e3d93c5d63f861,An Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Model for Emotion and Mental Health Detection,"Recent studies have highlighted several mental health problems in India, caused by factors such as lack of trained counsellors and a stigma associated with discussing mental health. These challenges have raised an increasing need for alternate methods that can be used to detect a person’s emotion and monitor their mental health. Existing research in this field explores several approaches ranging from studying body language to analysing micro-expressions to detect a person’s emotions. However, these solutions often rely on techniques that invade people’s privacy and thus face challenges with mass adoption. The goal is to build a solution that can detect people’s emotions, in a non-invasive manner. This research proposes a journaling web application wherein the users enter their daily reflections. The application extracts the user’s typing patterns (keystroke data) and primary phone usage data. It uses this data to train an ensemble machine learning model, which can then detect the user’s emotions. The proposed solution has various applications in today’s world. People can use it to keep track of their emotions and study their emotional health. Also, any individual family can use this application to detect early signs of anxiety or depression amongst the members.",2022,0.42510027
6f75e1f1843769d09ea883ccaa2993560cb360df,Applications of Machine Learning in Real-Life Digital Health Interventions: Review of the Literature,"Background Machine learning has attracted considerable research interest toward developing smart digital health interventions. These interventions have the potential to revolutionize health care and lead to substantial outcomes for patients and medical professionals. Objective Our objective was to review the literature on applications of machine learning in real-life digital health interventions, aiming to improve the understanding of researchers, clinicians, engineers, and policy makers in developing robust and impactful data-driven interventions in the health care domain. Methods We searched the PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to machine learning, to identify real-life studies of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms. We grouped those interventions according to their target (ie, target condition), study design, number of enrolled participants, follow-up duration, primary outcome and whether this had been statistically significant, machine learning algorithms used in the intervention, and outcome of the algorithms (eg, prediction). Results Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. Conclusions This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.",2019,0.5185355

d81323ed96f9cfd86469be14aa6edb4396aa7a3b,Machine learning techniques to predict daily rainfall amount,"Predicting the amount of daily rainfall improves agricultural productivity and secures food and water supply to keep citizens healthy. To predict rainfall, several types of research have been conducted using data mining and machine learning techniques of different countries’ environmental datasets. An erratic rainfall distribution in the country affects the agriculture on which the economy of the country depends on. Wise use of rainfall water should be planned and practiced in the country to minimize the problem of the drought and flood occurred in the country. The main objective of this study is to identify the relevant atmospheric features that cause rainfall and predict the intensity of daily rainfall using machine learning techniques. The Pearson correlation technique was used to select relevant environmental variables which were used as an input for the machine learning model. The dataset was collected from the local meteorological office at Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia to measure the performance of three machine learning techniques (Multivariate Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boost).

The ever increasing usage of Machine Learning techniques is the clearest example of such trend. This sort of revolution is often providing advantages, such as an increase in prediction accuracy and a reduced time to obtain the results. However, these methods present a major drawback: it is very difficult to understand on what grounds the algorithm took the decision. To address this issue we consider the LIME method. We give a general background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations. Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is crucial. As a case study, we apply both Machine Learning and classical statistical techniques to Credit Risk data. We test LIME on the Machine Learning algorithm and check its stability. Eventually, we examine the goodness of the explanations returned.",2020,0.46334177

c89629eab792c21842cf6843633fa6bca3bbe0ee,On Tilted Losses in Machine Learning: Theory and Applications,"Exponential tilting is a technique commonly used in fields such as statistics, probability, information theory, and optimization to create parametric distribution shifts. Despite its prevalence in related fields, tilting has not seen widespread use in machine learning. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring the use of tilting in risk minimization. We study a simple extension to ERM -- tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM) -- which uses exponential tilting to flexibly tune the impact of individual losses. The resulting framework has several useful properties: We show that TERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to enable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the tail probability of losses. Our work makes rigorous connections between TERM and related objectives, such as Value-at-Risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We develop batch and stochastic first-order optimization methods for solving TERM, provide convergence guarantees for the solvers, and show that the framework can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can be used for a multitude of applications in machine learning, such as enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling class imbalance. Despite the straightforward modification TERM makes to traditional ERM objectives, we find that the framework can consistently outperform ERM and deliver competitive performance with state-of-the-art, problem-specific approaches.",2021,0.36893442
